Tools and Methods

My tools and mind set going into any project is the UCD process. Research, design and development are all part of the process and should not be isolated. Instead, bridging them all together can make wonders for the result. 

I am a Certified ScrumMaster and have been practicing agile and lean methods since day one of working. I prefer to do things iteratively. Not only does it bring me closer to the way most developers work, but it also shorten the feedback loop considerably. That way I can learn quickly, discard ideas that does not work and keep refining the ideas that does.

##Learn
I am not the user even if I use the end result. Therefore I listen and learn before doing anything else.

Empathy for the user is something that always needs to be present. 

Balancing user needs against business objectives as well as technical and systematic constraints can sometimes be challenging, but it is also something that can be the most rewarding to overcome.

To do that, you can’t only study the user, but also study the system in which they reside.
####Tasks
Systems analysis • Interviews • Requirements gathering • Surveys • Personas • Scenarios

##Think
Combine two ideas, and you get a new idea. Visualize and draw the idea to see if it works and verify against personas and scenarios.

After learning about users and their system, we try to find solutions to their problems.

Some of the most essential tools here are conversation and discussion. For me this is when new ideas are born and solutions are found. Being able to listen to critique is also something I find very important.

After finding potential solutions, we need to test these solutions further by sketching, creating information architectures or interaction flows and concepts.
####Tasks
User journeys • Ideation • Mental models • Sketching • Information Architecture

##Make
Let’s hammer out the details. Now that we know what we need to do, this is how we will achieve it.

In this step we create wireframes, layouts, detailed documentation or prototypes in varying fidelity. These will describe how things should work and where they should be.

If I’m part of the implementing team, it might be enough to use the sketches from the previous step. I also make myself available for any 
questions and help out with coding and feasibility testing, if needed. 

####Tasks
Site maps • Wireframes • Prototyping • Coding

##Check
Got something that is touch, click or tap-able? Lets put it in front of the users sooner rather than later.
{: .lead}

When we have something that people can try out, I find it better to show it sooner rather than later. I test my ideas with paper or physical prototypes; HTML mock-ups or with a rough version of the real deal.

Rinse and repeat. A design never survives its first meeting with the user. What you find out in this step feeds into the next loop of learn, think, make and check.

####Tasks
User testing • A/B testing • Analytics
